## Python Paradigms

- **Procedural Programming:** A programming paradigm where code is organized into procedures or functions. The procedural approach focuses on the sequence of actions to be performed.
  
- **Function-Based Programming:** A paradigm that organizes code into functions. It emphasizes the use of functions to achieve code reusability and modularity.
  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** A paradigm that organizes code into objects and classes. It emphasizes the use of objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to model real-world entities.

- **Generators:** Special functions that return an iterator and yield values one at a time, allowing for efficient iteration over large data sets.

- **List Comprehensions:** A concise way to create lists based on existing lists or other iterables using a single line of code.

## Data Types of Python

- **String:** A sequence of characters enclosed in quotes. Strings are used to represent text and can be manipulated through various operations.
  
- **Integer:** A whole number without a fractional part. Integers are used for numerical operations and indexing.

- **Float:** A number with a decimal point. Floats are used to represent real numbers with fractional parts.

- **List:** An ordered, mutable collection of items that can be of different data types. Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

## Dictionary

- **Dictionary:** A collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique. Dictionaries are used to store data in a way that allows for fast lookups based on keys.

## Basic String Manipulation

- **Concatenation:** The operation of joining two or more strings into a single string.

- **Uppercase Conversion:** Changing all characters in a string to uppercase.

- **Length:** The number of characters in a string.

- **Substring Replacement:** Replacing a specified substring within a string with another substring.

- **Splitting:** Dividing a string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter.

## List

- **Creation:** Defining a list with initial elements.

- **Appending:** Adding an element to the end of a list.

- **Removal:** Removing an element from a list by index or value.

- **Sorting:** Arranging elements in a list in a specified order.

- **Indexing:** Finding the position of an element in a list.

## Tuple

- **Creation:** Defining a tuple with a fixed number of elements.

- **Accessing Elements:** Retrieving elements from a tuple by index.

- **Unpacking:** Assigning tuple elements to individual variables.

- **Concatenation:** Joining two or more tuples into a single tuple.

- **Membership Check:** Determining if an element exists in a tuple.

## Mutable and Immutable

- **Mutable Objects:** Objects whose state or contents can be changed after creation (e.g., lists, dictionaries).

- **Immutable Objects:** Objects whose state or contents cannot be changed after creation (e.g., strings, tuples).

## Nested Looping Operation

- **Multiplication Table:** Using nested loops to create a multiplication table.

- **Flattening:** Converting a nested list into a single list.

- **Patterns:** Generating patterns (e.g., stars) using nested loops.

- **Matrix Transposition:** Switching rows and columns in a matrix.

- **Dictionary of Lists:** Iterating through a dictionary where values are lists.

## Identity Operators

- **`is` Operator:** Checks if two variables point to the same object.

- **`is not` Operator:** Checks if two variables do not point to the same object.

## Membership Operators

- **`in` Operator:** Checks if an element exists in a sequence (list, string, tuple, etc.).

- **`not in` Operator:** Checks if an element does not exist in a sequence.

## Indexing

- **List Indexing:** Accessing elements in a list using indices.

- **String Indexing:** Accessing characters in a string using indices.

- **Tuple Indexing:** Accessing elements in a tuple using indices.

- **Negative Indexing:** Accessing elements from the end of a sequence using negative indices.

- **Nested List Indexing:** Accessing elements in a nested list.

## Slicing

- **List Slicing:** Extracting a portion of a list.

- **String Slicing:** Extracting a portion of a string.

- **Negative Index Slicing:** Using negative indices to slice from the end.

- **Tuple Slicing:** Extracting a portion of a tuple.

- **Reversing:** Reversing the order of elements in a sequence.

## User-Defined Functions (UDF)

- **Function Creation:** Defining functions to perform specific tasks.

- **Factorial Calculation:** Calculating the factorial of a number.

- **Prime Check:** Determining if a number is prime.

- **String Reversal:** Reversing a string.

- **Maximum of Three Numbers:** Finding the maximum of three numbers.

## Lambda Function

- **Lambda Expressions:** Anonymous functions defined using the `lambda` keyword.

- **Filtering:** Using lambda functions to filter elements from a list.

- **Sorting:** Using lambda functions to sort elements based on a key.

- **Mapping:** Applying lambda functions to transform elements in a list.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- **Class Definition:** Creating classes with attributes and methods.

- **Class Variables:** Defining variables shared across all instances of a class.

- **Inheritance:** Creating new classes based on existing classes.

- **Private Attributes:** Defining attributes that are not accessible outside the class.

- **Static Methods:** Defining methods that do not depend on class or instance attributes.

- **Method Resolution Order (MRO):** Determining the order in which methods are inherited.

- **Polymorphism:** Using a unified interface to interact with different types of objects.

- **Overriding:** Providing specific implementations of methods in derived classes.
